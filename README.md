Cloudinary wrapper for laravel

__Initially forked from https://github.com/teepluss/laravel4-cloudinary.
As it doesn't seem to be maintained anymore, and facing the lack of response from the original maitainer (issue opened + pull request opened, last commit on August last year), I decided to create a new fork that I plan on maintaining. We will move to Laravel 5 really soon, so I will also have a laravel 5 branch in development.__
